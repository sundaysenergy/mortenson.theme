We had very minimal down time and operated a fully occupied hospital during the entire demolition process with absolutely no incidents. This quality continued as we constructed the tower and we are currently complete with the 190,000 sq foot 6 story facility addition.

Mortenson did an exemplary job during that important period providing creative solutions to the inflationary challenges we encountered and working with our design team to balance user needs and expectations with available budget. They also demonstrated superior preplanning skills as they prepared to tackle the construction phase of our project. Their commitment to teamwork and to their customers has also been apparent as long as we’ve been working together. I am very happy to recommend Mortenson as technically strong, creative, and dependable partners for other healthcare organizations that have need for a strong builder.",

We were struggling to find design solutions to meet our budget restrictions and Mortenson was a critical team member providing estimating services and design-build solutions in concert with the subcontracting community that brought our scope of work within budget. Mortenson is committed to a unique Disruption Avoidance and Safety Program that has been critical to the success of keeping our hotel in operation during renovation. We have not had a single guest checkout early due to construction issues. This is a real testament to the effectiveness of this program when you consider the amount of heavy construction that is being executed within the hotel. I am happy to recommend M. A. Mortenson for hotel renovation work in Minneapolis. Our experience has been very positive.",
